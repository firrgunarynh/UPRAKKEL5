    content: "Feet are the foundation of climbing. Lots of beginners try to pull themselves up the wall and quickly tire out. Think about climbing a ladder—you don't pull yourself up, you step up, and use your arms and hands for balance. It's the same in climbing. Basic techniques for using your feet are edging and smearing: Edging is exactly what it sounds like: You step on a hold with the rubber on the edge of your shoe. You can use the inside edge, where your big toe offers stability on smaller holds, or you can use the outside edge. Your choice depends on the direction you need to move in order to get on or off the hold. Smearing happens when you don't have an actual foothold, so you rely on your shoe's rubber for friction against the rock. Smearing is useful in slab climbing, when you're on low-angle rock without many defined footholds. When you smear, look for small depressions or protrusions that will give a little extra friction. You can also flatten out the angle for slightly better purchase. Keep the following footwork tactics in mind when climbing: Try to keep your feet directly below you. Keep an eye out for footholds in good positions, so you can maintain better balance. Look for foot placements even more than for handholds. Once you set your foot, keep it still. You'll have a better chance of staying on the hold as you make your next move. Keep your heel low so you have plenty of contact with the wall. With a high heel less rubber is on the rock, reducing friction and increasing the odds that you'll lever your foot off the wall when you make your next move.",

    content: "Rock climbing has roots in Victorian mountaineering and recreational climbing in Europe in the late 19th century, evolving from a necessity to a specialized sport. The first mountaineering club, the Alpine Club, formed in 1857, helped spread climbing ideals internationally and led to equipment innovations like ropes, pitons, and carabiners. By the 1950s, rock climbing became a recognized sport, with organized competitions emerging in the USSR and planned overnight climbs becoming a reality",

    excerpt: "This post will give you a lesson about surfing",
    content: "Anyone that’s been on the beginner’s surf course at UP Surf Coaching will know that I outline the process of becoming a surfer on day one. I do this because many beginners do things that slow their progress or they have unrealistic expectations that lead to an unnecessary feeling of failure. A key thing to keep in mind is that when you first attempt surfing out the back as opposed to in the shore-break, your wave count will go right down and that is OK, it’s normal. Don’t be discouraged. In the whitewater you can expect to catch around 50 waves within one session and that is why the whitewater is the best place to perfect your pop up technique and stance initially. But once out the back hunting your first green waves without a coach to help you position yourself, you may only catch 1 or 2 waves in a session. Many beginners seem to feel bad about that, especially if they see other surfers catching plenty of waves. But if you’ve increased your paddle fitness, been observant and learnt about where the waves break and enjoyed even one nice ride, I’d call that a very successful surf for a novice. So, the process for learning to surf goes like this: start in the whitewater and don’t leave it until your pop up and stance are rock solid start catching small green wave ‘reforms’ in the shorebreak, or out the back if the swell is tiny, learn to surf across them using your rails learn how to read a surf forecast and get clear on the best types of waves for beginners and how to predict when they will happen and where learn how to read a surf spot, where the waves break, where they don’t and where to paddle out, plus learn the techniques used to paddle out efficiently paddle out the back and start catching slightly bigger green waves – be very observant and work on positioning, try to catch waves as early as possible so they aren’t too steep stick at it and you will soon improve your fitness,  your wave count will increase steadily, as will your actual wave-riding skills – and from here on in it’s a lot more fun",

    content: "Beginner Boards: Longer, wider boards, such as foam or soft-surface boards, are highly recommended for beginners. Advanced Boards: Shorter, slimmer boards can help improve maneuverability and speed. The Importance of a Leash: A leash is essential for beginners to prevent the board from flying off and prevent injury. Safety: Learning with a coach will give you a better understanding of the basics, including how to paddle, stand on the board, and fall safely. Technique: A coach will help you understand basic techniques such as paddling, take-off, and maintaining balance. Waiting Your Turn: If another surfer is closer to the wave, let them go first. Not Interfering: Avoid interfering with other surfers by keeping your distance and not cutting them off. Communication: Communicating with other surfers can help avoid accidents and create a more enjoyable atmosphere. Warm-up: Warm up before surfing to avoid cramps and prepare your body. Land Workout: Exercises like lunges, squats, and planks can help improve strength and balance. Balance: After take-off, focus on maintaining balance with bent knees and relaxed arms.",

    content: "Skydiving is an athletic activity, and it’s important to dress the part. You’ll find yourself in many different positions at various points in your skydive, so you want to wear clothes that are comfortable and easy to move around in. Think of dressing for the gym. How are you going to do any skydiving tricks if you are wearing tight, uncomfortable clothing?! You don’t want anything that will restrict you from bending over or arching your back, and you want to be comfortable when you are riding up in the plane. Is it better to wear shorts or pants when skydiving? Pants, for a few different reasons. Even if it’s hot on the ground, the temperature at altitude is much cooler – and 120 mph wind adds to that chill, so it’s best to have your arms and legs covered during your jump. You also want to consider your landing when deciding what to wear. There is a good chance you will be sliding in on your butt, so having pants to cover your legs is a good idea. Check out these landing tips to see what we mean. You are probably asking yourself, “how do I calm my nerves before skydiving?” The short answer is, that’s up to you! Everyone deals with stress differently, and only you really know what helps keep you calm. However, there are some common ways to help with nerves on your big day and prepare for your first skydive. One of the best tips before skydiving is to think about breathing. Effective breathing helps regulate stress in your body and mind, and it gives you something to focus on other than what you are about to do. Deep, consistent breaths will keep you focused and oxygenated, allowing your mind to relax. You can also use this breathing to practice for your skydive. Continuing the controlled, rhythmic breathing throughout your jump will keep you calm, cool, and collected, and allow you to focus on the amazing experience! In case you were wondering, you can breathe while skydiving. You can also spend time doing whatever it is that helps you de-stress before you come to the dropzone the day of your jump. Whether it’s running, yoga, talking to a friend, or reading a book, anything helps! Set aside time that morning to focus on yourself and get your head in the right place. Reading reviews from people who jumped before you might help, too!",

    excerpt: "This post will tell you a lesson about skateboard",
    content: "Finding the right place to learn how to skateboard is important for your own safety. A smooth and lesser-used sidewalk or bike path is a great place to start. Alternatively, an empty street or parking lot can also be a good option, as long as it's free from obstacles and hazards. However, if the sidewalk has huge cracks or is in poor condition, it's best to find a smoother surface to avoid tripping or falling. It's important to learn the basics of pushing and riding around before going to a skatepark. Skateparks can be crowded and chaotic, and it may not be the best place for beginners to learn. It's always a good idea to practice in a less busy area until you feel comfortable on your board. If a skatepark is the only option, try to find an area where you won't get in the way of more experienced skaters. This could mean finding a quieter area of the park or waiting until a less busy time of day to practice. Learning to skateboard takes time and patience, so it's important to take things slow and not get discouraged. Starting on a smooth surface and practicing basic techniques will help you build confidence and improve your skills. As you progress, you can gradually challenge yourself by trying new tricks and riding on different surfaces. We do suggest that when learning to skateboard you should always wear proper safety gear, including a helmet, knee pads, and elbow pads, to protect yourself from injury.",

    content: "Bend Your Knees Maintaining a low and relaxed stance is essential for all skateboarding tricks as it gives you the ability to adjust your balance quickly in any situation. By bending your knees, you can absorb shocks and maintain your balance on the board, making it easier to control and maneuver. Be Determined Practice and dedication are key to learning how to skate. Don't expect to be good right away, as skateboarding can be difficult and takes time to master. Remember that the challenge is part of what makes skateboarding so gratifying and keep pushing yourself to improve. Be Ready to Fall Falling is an unavoidable part of skateboarding. It's important to invest in a helmet and protective gear such as knee pads and elbow pads to protect yourself from injury. Being prepared to fall and knowing how to do so safely can help you keep skating and falling for life. Use Quality Equipment Skateboards from department stores may have poor-quality parts and not perform as well as boards from actual skate companies. This can be frustrating and make learning to skate discouraging. Invest in quality gear from top skate brands to ensure that your skateboard performs well and is durable. This includes your skate deck, but also your trucks, wheels and skate hardware.  ",

    excerpt: "This post will give you information history of skateboard",
    content: "By the early 1950s, surfing can be traced as the source of skateboarding. Some surfers had the idea to transfer the feeling of riding waves onto the streets to defy times of days with a gentle swell. Not without any reason these dudes were called “asphalt surfers”. At two spots in the world a kind of a skateboard was developed at the first time in the early 1950s: California and Hawaii. They used shorter surfboards and wheels made out of metal without some bearings. In the late 1950s, skateboarding had a first peak. During the post-war period, the U.S. economy boomed and this also affected the toy industry. During that time, the toy industry became aware of the board with wheels. In 1959, Roller Derby released the first official skateboard with some new technical developments. Thereby, the handling characteristics have been improved. For this reason, skateboarders were able to develop new tricks and maneuvers. Between the years 1959 and 1965, skateboarding became more and more popular in the United States. Particularly affected were the states on the east and west coasts. Due to the industrial development, the skateboard’s status changed from toy to sports equipment. In 1962, the surf shop “Val-Surf” in Hollywood sold the first self-produced skateboards. These boards featured a typical surfboard shape and roller skate trucks and were sold as complete boards. In the same year, the company Patterson Forbes developed the first industrially produced complete boards with more developed trucks. In 1963, the publisher of the “Surf Guide Magazine” Larry Stevenson released the first advertisement for skateboards in his magazine. Also the clothing industry specialized more and more on skateboarding. One of the most famous skateboarding shoe brand named Vans was established in 1966. From this day on, Vans supported skateboarders from all over the world. Especially shoe companies like Vans, Etnies, Converse and DC Shoes developed and manufactured skateboarding related footwear and streetwear. ",

    content: "The best way to get into paragliding is to take an introductory course. This introduction will allow you to escape for a moment and discover the benefits of this sport. Everyone has always wondered what birds feel while flying, right? This is the chance to find out through a sensational experience: a two-seater paragliding flight. So the paragliding introduction takes place with an instructor who will oversee the flight from take-off to landing. You can ask them any questions you wish. They're there to explain the steps involved in a flight. Do you want to take your interest in this sport further? We therefore recommend you do an introductory course. It will allow you to gradually get a flavour of paragliding, be introduced to and learn how to use the equipment. You will learn the take-off and landing rules, learn the safety rules, and take your first solo flight. Most paragliding schools offer courses lasting between one and five days. At the beginning of the course, you will be accompanied by an instructor who will guide you and give you both theoretical and practical courses to help you become independent and to pilot your paraglider like a boss! Don't panic, on your first flights, you will be guided by radio with an instructor at the end of the line. One instructor stays at the take-off location and another at the landing site. However, doing an introductory course does not mean that you will be able to fly perfectly, especially not at all paragliding sites and in all weather conditions. It is important to remember that a pilot only feels truly ready and comfortable to handle their canopy after at least three courses. Do not hesitate to take several courses, including a more advanced course after your initiation. This will not only allow you to gain confidence in the air but also fly with greater peace of mind and in complete safety.",

    excerpt: "This post will give you a lesson about paragliding",
    content: "The origin of paragliding has roots in the sport of parachuting. In the early 1960’s, American parachutist Pierre Lemoigne was successful in cutting slots in the round parachute canopy to allow for air to flow through the canopy. This had a dramatic effect on the lift to drag ratio and allowed for the pilot to steer the chute in a predictable manner. In 1962, Walter Newmark of England took note of Lemoigne’s design and modified it so the chute could be towed aloft. During the 60’s, parascending become a popular sport amongst the English. Newmark was responsible for the creation of the British Association of Parascending in the early 1970’s. In 1964, Domina Jalbert of Florida invented a square canopy called the Ram Air Para Foil. The Ram Air worked by allowing air to pass through the double surface glider allowing for better maneuverability and increased lift. Walter Newmark soon adopted this canopy for his parascending activities. Not until the 1970’s did the sport take off. The popularity of paragliding arose when pilots in the French town of Mieussy successfully launched the wing by running down the hillsides of the Alps. Andre Bohn and Gerard Bosson were mostly responsible for developing the sport into how it is today. Bosson introduced paragliding at the 1979 World Hang Gliding Championships. It was not long until paragliding schools were opening up around the world.",
